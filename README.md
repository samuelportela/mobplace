# Fast development with Ripple
After downloading the source code, add the android platform, for instance:

    $ cordova platform add android

Then, you can emulate the app using Ripple:

    $ ripple emulate

# Developing with Eclipse + ADT

    $ cordova build
    After that, import the project into Eclipse + ADT

**Tips:**
* After you modify some app file, run the command "cordova build" again, refresh Eclipse Package Explorer tree and then run the app again;
* Use Intel x86 Atom System Image for a faster emulation.
